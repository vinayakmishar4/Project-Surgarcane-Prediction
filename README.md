# Sugarcane Production Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on sugarcane production across different countries. The analysis is performed using a dataset that includes production metrics, land usage, yield, and more. The project aims to uncover patterns and insights related to sugarcane production.
Project Overview
# Dataset
   # Source
   The dataset used in this project is titled "List of Countries by Sugarcane Production". It contains various metrics related to sugarcane production for different countries, including:

  # Country: 
  The name of the country.
  # Production (Tons):
  The total sugarcane production in tons.
  # Production per Person (Kg):
  The average sugarcane production per person in kilograms.
  # Acreage (Hectare):
  The total land area used for sugarcane production in hectares.
  # Yield (Kg / Hectare):
  The yield of sugarcane per hectare of land.
# Data Cleaning
The dataset is cleaned to handle missing values, and data types are adjusted to ensure accurate analysis. Some columns are renamed for better readability and consistency.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The analysis includes the following key steps:

Importing necessary libraries (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib).
Loading and inspecting the dataset.
Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis.
Visualizing key metrics such as production, acreage, and yield.
Performing correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.
Analysis Focus
# Country-Level Analysis: 
Examines sugarcane production and related metrics on a per-country basis.
# Continent-Level Analysis: 
Aggregates data by continent to identify regional patterns in sugarcane production.
# Results
# Production vs. Land: 
The analysis suggests that increasing land acreage can lead to higher production of sugarcane.
# Yield Efficiency: 
Countries with higher yield per hectare do not necessarily produce more sugarcane overall, indicating other factors might be influencing production.
# Continental Insights: 
Certain continents dominate in sugarcane production, with notable differences in land usage and production efficiency.
